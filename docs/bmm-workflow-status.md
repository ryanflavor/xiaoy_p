## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Instruction Set:** default
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** greenfield

### Scope Summary

- **Estimated Stories:** TBD
- **Estimated Epics:** TBD
- **Timeline:** TBD

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

- Brainstorming results, research insights, product brief; then PRD/Tech-Spec and stories

### Workflow Sequence

- Analysis: brainstorm-project → research (optional) → product-brief
- Planning: PRD or Tech-Spec (based on level) → ux-spec (UI projects)
- Solutioning: solution-architecture (Level 3-4 only)
- Implementation: create-story → story-ready → story-context → dev-story → story-approved

### Next Actions

- Run: bmad pm prd   （Level 2–4）
- 或：bmad pm tech-spec   （Level 0–1）
- 完成后，运行：bmad pm workflow-status（查看后续建议）

## Special Considerations

- Include UX workflow due to UI components

## Technical Preferences Captured

- Language: Chinese

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 0 (Single Atomic Change)

- **Format:** `story-<short-title>.md`
- **Example:** `story-icon-migration.md`, `story-login-fix.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** 1 (if more needed, consider Level 1)

### Level 1 (Coherent Feature)

- **Format:** `story-<title>-<n>.md`
- **Example:** `story-oauth-integration-1.md`, `story-oauth-integration-2.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** 2-3 (prefer longer stories over more stories)

### Level 2+ (Multiple Epics)

- **Format:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`
- **Example:** `story-1.1.md`, `story-1.2.md`, `story-2.1.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** Per epic breakdown in epics.md
